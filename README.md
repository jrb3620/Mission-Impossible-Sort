There were a few parts to this lab:
1) We had to convert a circular linked list into a doubly linked list, using integers as the pointers rather than actual pointers.
2) We had to develop an algorithm to sort them first by job type, age, and then finally by name.
3) We were not allowed to use "new", instead, we had to allocate them in the stack manually.
4) We had to develop a generic template for vehicles (sorted by manufacturer, then doors, then model name)
5) We had to use inheritance to allow employees to own the vehicles.
6) We had to attach a linked list of each employee's vehicles to their node, allowing employees to own multiple different vehicles of different types.
